### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Fall 2020

+ Projec title: What do supporters of Trump and Biden think about Trump as the president in the last four years?
+ This project is conducted by [Yue Liang](https://github.com/yuesabinaliang).

+ Project summary: As the election 2020 is closer, the competition between Trump and Biden is becoming a hot topic in this special year. People all over the world pay attention to the results. This year many new issues happened, such as COVID-19, Black lives matters protest. By analyzing the 2020 Exploratory Testing Survey dataset from ANES(American National Election Studies), I gained some interesting information about the election. The dataset contains information on the novel issues arising in the election year, which was collected by a survey between Apr 10 and Apr 18. 

From my analysis, I found out that while about 87% people keeps a stand from 2016 to this year, some people have changed their minds. More people change from Trump’s camp to Biden’s than from Biden’s group to Trump’s. But some of the Biden’s camp leave to someone else’s camp. Worth mentioning, Biden attracts more people who quit voting in 2016 to his camp this year than Trump does. 

Overall, Trump’s supporters approve Trump’s job moderately, while Biden’s supporters disapprove of Trump’s job extremely. In terms of economics, most of Biden’s supporters think that the economy is much worse than one year ago, While Trump’s supporters’ opinions are more likely to split evenly on different thoughts. In terms of Health Care & COVID-19, Trump’s supporters are not as worried about their chances of getting COVID-19 as Biden’s supporters. Also, Trump’s supporters oppose the idea of government should pay for the health care of all Americans a great deal, while Biden’s supporters favor the idea a great deal.
